# Steam Controller for Android TV (SHIELD TV)

> **SHIELD TV fork.** This is a fork of [SonicDX12/SteamController-Android](https://github.com/SonicDX12/SteamController-Android)
> focused on **Android TV**, and tested **only on an NVIDIA SHIELD TV (2019 "tube" model,
> Android 11, `armeabi-v7a`)**. It has not been tested on phones, tablets, or any other TV
> device. Upstream is the place to go for general Android use.
>
> Releases here are built from this fork and are signed with a different key than upstream,
> so you cannot install one over the other — uninstall first (export your settings from
> inside the app beforehand).
>
> **What this fork changes**
>
> *Fixes found while debugging on real hardware:*
> - Leaked virtual input devices are reaped on startup. Each ungraceful stop previously left
>   a dead gamepad, mouse and keyboard registered with Android until reboot; a game claiming
>   "player 1" then bound to the oldest corpse, so the controller did nothing in-game while
>   the app still reported itself connected. This was the cause of "my controller stops
>   working when I switch to GeForce NOW".
> - The BLE subscription chain no longer stalls. A dropped GATT callback left the app
>   subscribed only to the first notify characteristic, reporting the controller ready while
>   no input could ever arrive.
> - The controller is matched by name rather than MAC. The SC2026's BLE address rotates, so a
>   stored address went stale and the app silently failed to connect until the device was
>   re-picked by hand.
> - Capacitive button bits (trackpad touch, grips, stick touch) are no longer frozen by the
>   button debounce, which had broken the sidecar trackpad mouse.
> - The fallback injection path actually sends button events; it previously compared a frame
>   against itself and emitted nothing but axes.
> - Service shutdown no longer runs blocking binder calls on the main thread, and no longer
>   closes the USB connection while the read loop is still inside `bulkTransfer`.
>
> *Android TV specifics:*
> - NVIDIA SHIELD visual theme, and a layout that fits a 1080p screen without scrolling.
> - Visible DPAD focus on the primary action.
> - An **Install Shizuku** button, since Shizuku has no leanback launcher and is invisible on
>   the SHIELD home screen.
> - Per-frame allocation removed from the input hot path, which matters on the 2 GB tube.

Use the **Steam Controller 2026** (Valve, codename *Ibex*) as a standard Android gamepad — no root required. Connect via USB OTG / wireless Puck, or directly via Bluetooth.

The app reads the controller's proprietary HID protocol and exposes it to Android as a virtual gamepad through Linux `uinput` (accessed via Shizuku), so any game that supports controllers sees a real input device — Xbox 360, Xbox One, DualShock 4 or DualSense, your choice. A **Desktop mode** turns the same controller into a virtual mouse + keyboard, ideal for Android TV boxes.

## Features

### Connection
- **USB OTG** — wired or via the wireless Puck dongle
- **Bluetooth LE** — direct pairing with the controller, no dongle needed
- **Live transport switching** in the UI (toggle group with USB and Bluetooth icons)
- **Refresh paired BT devices** without restarting the app
- **In-app help dialog** explaining the controller's wireless mode combos (Steam+A+R1, Steam+B+R1, etc.)

### Emulation
- **Five virtual profiles**: Xbox 360 (default), Xbox One, Sony DualShock 4, Sony DualSense, and **Desktop** (mouse + keyboard)
- **Cycle gamepad profiles directly from the notification** (`↻ → next profile`) without opening the app
- **Real `InputDevice`** via Linux `uinput` (UID shell via Shizuku UserService) — recognised by games as a real gamepad, not filtered like injected events
- **Automatic fallback** to `IInputManager.injectInputEvent` if `/dev/uinput` is denied (less compatible, kept as safety net)

### Desktop mode
- Turns the controller into a virtual **mouse + keyboard** — right trackpad drives the cursor, left trackpad scrolls, buttons map to common keys (volume, play/pause, back, home, enter, escape, tab, space, etc.)
- Even while a gamepad profile is active, the trackpads can double as a mouse sidecar (toggle in Calibration) so you can still navigate menus without switching profiles
- Full **Android TV** support: dedicated banner/leanback UI, D-pad focus navigation, on-screen keyboard shows up correctly when a text field is focused

### Game Profiles
- Save the current calibration, button mapping, rumble intensity and mouse sensitivity as a **named preset**
- Load, rename, duplicate or delete presets from a dedicated screen
- **Bind a preset to one or more apps** — the service automatically switches profile when you launch a bound game (foreground-app detection, no manual step)

### Tuning
- **Per-stick calibration** — radial dead zone (0–30%), center offset capture, Y-axis inversion, live 2D preview
- **Custom button mapping** — categorised list (Face / Bumpers / Triggers full-press / Stick clicks / System / Back paddles / Grips), using the official Steam Input button icons. Any source button to any target, including back paddles L4/L5/R4/R5, the Quick Access Menu button, and forcing a trigger to "fully pulled"
- **Special actions** — map any button to **📸 Take screenshot** (saved in Pictures/Screenshots, visible immediately in the gallery)
- **Rumble forwarding pipeline** with adjustable intensity (0–100%) and a manual "Test rumble" button (Bluetooth only for now — see Known limitations)

### Backup & restore
- **Export** every live setting and all Game Profiles to a single JSON file via the system file picker
- **Import** that file back at any time — handy after reinstalling the app or moving to a new phone

### Auto-update
- Checks GitHub Releases for a newer version at launch (once every 24h) or on demand
- Shows the release notes and downloads the signed APK straight from GitHub, then hands off to the system installer

### Debug & status
- **HID debug view** — every button, stick, trigger, trackpad, IMU quaternion and raw hex dump, updated at the controller's ~300 Hz
- **Battery indicator** in the status card and in the notification — works over both USB and Bluetooth
- **Persistent foreground service notification** with the active emulation profile, battery, profile-cycle action, and stop action

### Platform
- **Material 3** design with Steam blue accents
- **Adaptive layouts** — phone (max-width 520dp), tablet (`sw600dp`, two-column layouts) and Android TV (`television`, leanback navigation)

## Requirements

- Android 8.0+ (API 26) — phone, tablet, or Android TV
- [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) installed and running
- For USB: USB Host (OTG) support on the phone/tablet
- For Bluetooth: standard BLE (available on every modern Android)
- A **Steam Controller 2026** (Valve Ibex). The older Steam Controller is not yet supported.

## Setup

1. Install [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) and start it (ADB Wireless on Android 11+, or one-time ADB cable for older versions).
2. Install this app and grant it the Shizuku permission when prompted.
3. Grant the **POST_NOTIFICATIONS** permission when asked (Android 13+) so the foreground status notification shows up.
4. **For USB**: plug the Puck (or the controller directly) into the OTG port. Android will ask for USB permission.
5. **For Bluetooth**: pair the controller via Android Settings → Bluetooth first, then select it from the Bluetooth device dropdown in the app. Use the `↻` refresh button if you just paired it.
6. Pick the emulated controller profile (Xbox 360 is the safest default for games — broadest compatibility. Pick Desktop for mouse + keyboard, e.g. on Android TV).
7. Hit **Start Service**. The status card shows `Mode: <profile> (uinput) ✓` when everything is up.
8. Optional: tune everything to your liking (calibration, mapping, rumble) and save it as a **Game Profile** — bind it to a game so it auto-loads next time you launch it.

If `uinput` is blocked by SELinux on your device (rare on stock Android, possible on some hardened ROMs), the app falls back to `injectInputEvent`, which works in most apps but is filtered by many games.

                        Android sees a real "Microsoft

```

The HID protocol is parsed natively and translated into the chosen profile's button/axis layout before being written to a virtual gamepad created via Linux `uinput`. The Shizuku `UserService` runs as the `shell` user (UID 2000) which has access to `/dev/uinput` on most Android builds.

For BLE, the standard HID service (`0x1812`) is claimed by the OS, so the app uses Valve's vendor service (`100f6c32-1735-4313-b402-38567131e5f3`) directly. Connection priority is bumped to `HIGH` after connect to bring the BLE interval from ~50 ms down to ~11 ms.

## Build

Standard Android Gradle build, requires:

- Android Studio Hedgehog or newer
- Android Gradle Plugin 8.5+
- Kotlin 2.0+
- NDK + CMake 3.22.1 (for the native `uinput` JNI library)

**First time:** open the project in Android Studio and let it sync — this regenerates the Gradle wrapper. After that:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
# APK lands in app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
```

The app supports `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a` and `x86_64` ABIs.

For signed release builds and publishing to GitHub Releases, see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

## Configuration

Live settings and Game Profiles are persisted in `SharedPreferences`:

- Selected transport (USB or Bluetooth) and paired BT device address
- Emulated profile (Xbox 360 / Xbox One / DS4 / DualSense / Desktop)
- Per-stick calibration (dead zone, center offset, invert Y)
- Per-button mapping (source buttons → Xbox targets, keyboard keys, or special actions like screenshot)
- Rumble intensity (0–100%) and mouse sensitivity (Desktop mode / trackpad sidecar)
- Named Game Profiles, each with its own copy of the settings above plus the list of apps it auto-switches on

You can tweak everything live — most changes apply within ~250 ms (next mapping cache refresh) without restarting the service. Changing transport or emulated profile requires restarting the service (or use the notification's profile cycle action). Use **Export backup** / **Import backup** in the Game Profiles screen to move all of this to a JSON file — useful before uninstalling the app or when setting it up on a new device.

## Known limitations

- **`shell` UID access to `/dev/uinput`** depends on the device's SELinux policy. Most stock Android builds allow it; some hardened ROMs may not. The app falls back to `injectInputEvent` automatically in that case.
- **Steam button** passes through as `KEYCODE_BUTTON_MODE`. Android handles it as the system "Guide" key which may open the launcher in some setups.
- **Rumble byte format** is an empirically-tuned best guess based on the Linux `hid-steam` driver. Works over Bluetooth. **USB rumble is not implemented yet** — the controller only vibrates when connected over BT.
- **Trackpads**: usable as a mouse (Desktop mode, or as an optional sidecar cursor alongside a gamepad profile). Not yet exposed as a DualShock 4/DualSense touchpad to games that support one natively.
- **Gyroscope** (quaternion IMU) is parsed but not yet routed anywhere. Gyro aiming is planned for a future release, fits best with the DualShock 4 / DualSense profiles.
- **Bluetooth auto-reconnect**: if the controller powers off, the app does not retry the GATT connection.
- **Shizuku at reboot**: the user must restart Shizuku after each reboot of the device (an Android limitation, not the app's).

## Roadmap

- USB rumble implementation
- Trackpad as a real touchpad input (DS4/DualSense profile) for games that support it
- Gyro aiming for DS4 / DualSense profiles
- USB / BT auto-reconnect
- HID debug log export ("Log to File")
